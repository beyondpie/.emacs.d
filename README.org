* My dot emacs
  My configuration for emacs since Dec, 2020 till now.
  - Emacs version: latest (current 30.05 in development)
  - System: MacOS (mainly) / Ubuntu [not often]
  - GUI (mainly) and terminal version are supported.
  - Now maintained at:
    - https://git.sr.ht/~szu/.emacs.d (major)
    - https://github.com/beyondpie/.emacs.d (mirror)
    
  
  I learn a lot from spacemacs, which is a popular emacs configuration. I used it during 2017-2020.
  The key features I like:
  - Integrate the evil package very well.
  - Use leader keys to simplify key bindings, such as "space" in evil normal mode, "comma" for major mode, and so on.
  - Jumping among different windows easily with the support of the evil package.

  After reading part of the source codes in spacemacs, I know I can
  handle the similar experience with the packages:
  - *general*: leader keybindings
  - *evil*: vim in emacs
  - *evil-collection*: make evil more smooth.
  - *helm*: search anytime, anywhere.
