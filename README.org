* My dot emacs
  My configuration for emacs.
  
  I learn a lot from spacemacs, which is a popular emacs configuration. I use it since 2017 till 2020.
  The key features I like:
  - Integrate the evil package very well.
  - Use leader keys to simplify key bindings, such as "space" in evil normal mode, "comma" for major mode, and so on.
  - Jumping among different windows easily with the support of the evil package.

  The reason I left spacemacs because I think it's a good opportunity
  now for me to learn emacs in depth, and make the configurations
  light, simple, controllable by myself.

  After reading part of the source codes in spacemacs, I know I can
  handle the similar experience with the packages:
  - *general*: leader keybindings
  - *evil*: vim in emacs
  - *evil-collection*: make evil more smooth.
  - *helm*: search anytime, anywhere. 
 
** Note for this configuration
  - System: MacOS and Linux
  - Both GUI and terminal are considered.
  - Emacs verion: >= 27.1
  - Highly used packages:
    - *use-package*: manage the packages
    - *general*: key binding, especially useful with use-package
    - *evil*: my vim editor (hybrid: insert mode use emacs command)
    - *magit*: git
    - *helm*: search, match and so on. highly integrated
    - *vterm*: common shell usage
    - *projectile*: project management
    - *treemacs*: list of files and functions
    - *lsp*: unified programming language server
    - programming language related:
      - *auctex*: Latex
      - *lsp-pyright* + *python-mode*: python
      - *ess*: R
      - *company*: code completion
      - *flycheck*: check syntax
    - *pdf-tools*: view pdf (GUI mode)
