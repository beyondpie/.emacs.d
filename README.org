* My dot emacs
  This configuration is only used personally for learning emacs in
  depth. It is influenced heavily by spacemacs, which I use for near 4
  years. The key features I like:
  - Key bindings: /SPC/ as the leader key in normal mode; /,/ as the
    leader key for major mode.
  - Window-related quick jumps.
 
** Note for this configuration
  - System: MacOS and Linux
  - GUI mainly, terminal should be OK
  - Emacs verion: >= 27.1
  - Highly used packages:
    - *use-package*: manage the packages
    - *general*: key binding, especially useful with use-package
    - *evil*: my vim editor (hybrid: insert mode use emacs command)
    - *magit*: git
    - *helm*: search, match and so on. highly integrated
    - *vterm*: common shell usage
    - *projectile*: project management
    - *treemacs*: list of files and functions
    - *lsp*: unified programming language server
    - programming language related:
      - *auctex*: Latex
      - *lsp-pyright* + *python-mode*: python
      - *ess*: R
      - *company*: code completion
      - *flycheck*: check syntax
    - *pdf-tools*: view pdf (GUI mode)
  - May change a lot.
