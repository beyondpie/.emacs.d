* 29 Garden Street Emacs
  My configuration for emacs since Dec, 2020 till now.
  - Emacs version: latest (current 30.05 in development)
  - System: MacOS and Linux
  
  I learn a lot from spacemacs, which is a popular emacs
  configuration. I used it during 2017-2020. The key features I like:
  - Integrate the evil package very well.
  - Use leader keys to simplify key bindings, such as "space" in evil
    normal mode, "comma" for major mode, and so on.
  - Jumping among different windows easily with the support of the
    evil package.

  After reading part of the source codes in spacemacs, I know I can
  handle the similar experience with the packages:
  - [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general]]: leader keybindings
  - [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil]]: vim in emacs
  - [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]]: make evil more smooth.
  - [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]]: search anytime, anywhere.
  - [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot (default in Emacs)]] or [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp (provide majority of utilities)]]:
    provide powerful, unified programming language support.
