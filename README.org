* 29 Garden Street Emacs
  My configuration for emacs since Dec, 2020 till now.
  - Emacs version: latest (current 30.05 in development)
  - System: MacOS and Linux
  
  I learn a lot from spacemacs, which is a popular emacs
  configuration. I used it during 2017-2020. The key features I like:
  - Integrate the evil package very well.
  - Use leader keys to simplify key bindings, such as "space" in evil
    normal mode, "comma" for major mode, and so on.
  - Jumping among different windows easily with the support of the
    evil package.

  After reading part of the source codes in spacemacs, I know I can
  handle the similar experience with the packages:
  - [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general]]: leader keybindings
  - [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil]]: vim in emacs
  - [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]]: make evil more smooth.
  - [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]]: search anytime, anywhere.
  - [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot (default in Emacs)]] or [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp (provide majority of utilities)]]:
    provide powerful, unified programming language support.

** Install Emacs
   - macOS: [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]] or [[https://emacsformacos.com/][Emacs for macOS]].
   - Linux: follow the instruction from the official website

** Configurations
   Emacs needs to read a configuration file =init.el=, just like the
   one in this repository. In order to use the configurations here,
   you can
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # back up original configuration if you have.
  cp -r ~/.emacs.d ~/dot_emacsd_bk
  # download this configuration.
  cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/beyondpie/.emacs.d
  # download the packages this configuration needs
  cd ~/.emacs.d && git clone https://github.com/beyondpie/myelpa
#+END_SRC
   

** Explanations about packages
   - In current config, we use ~(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "~/.emacs.d/myelpa/")))~ in =~/.emacs.d/init.el=
     to set the local archieves, where myelpa points to the git repository above.
   - If you want to use network to install packages (this happens when you have your configurations, and
     packages are not included in myelpa), you can firstly
     use ~(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packges/")))~. Then generate the local archives
     by yourself.
   - We can also use both local and website by setting different names of the package archives and set it explicitly
     when using =use-package= to install some package.
